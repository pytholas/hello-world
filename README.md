# hello-world
Just saying hello.
I have recently been awarded a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Idaho. I am also qualified for senior discounts here and there, so actually breaking into the industry might prove to be more of a challenge than I'd anticipated. I will however keep shuffling down this path, since in plain contrast to what I keep telling myself, I never actually wanted to be a lumberjack.
